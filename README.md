# Upi_FraudDetection_ML
Built a simple machine learning model with Linear Regression to predict fraudulent UPI transactions. Used SMOTE to balance the data by generating synthetic fraud samples. The model learns patterns from transaction features like amount, time, and merchant category to identify fraud risk. This provides a clear and easy baseline for fraud detection.
